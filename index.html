<h2 id="story">The story</h2>
<p class="bold">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p> 
<p>They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,<strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe. </q></strong>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too bad</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
<q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe. </q></strong></p>

<blockquote cite="https://wellsbaum.blog/2018/01/27/alan-watts-the-story-of-the-chinese-farmer/">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good" id="good">good</em> or <em class="bad" id="bad">bad</em> — 
because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>  
<p><em class="good" id="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad" id="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
